# WordPress Power-UP - Code Snippet Library

This is a community-maintained repository of code snippets that help modify the default behavior of WordPress.

Snippets are organized into categories (folders) and each snippet is placed in its own file with a name that describes what it does.

## Using Snippets

1. Click on the filename of the snippet you'd like to use.
2. Click the "Raw" button (next to "Blame" and "History") at the top right.
3. Copy and Paste the code into your theme or child theme's functions.php or place inside a custom functionality plugin.

If you need help customizing any of the snippets or do not understand how to use them, we recommend [hiring a consultant](http://thewpleague.com/consultants/).

## Submitting Your Snippet

We welcome and encourage everyone to submit their code snippets. If you would like to submit your snippet, please fork the repository and then create a pull request.

Please refer to the [Contributing guidelines](https://github.com/thewpleague/wordpress-powerup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting your pull request.

## Proposing a Snippet

If there is a snippet you are unable to find and would like to propose get written, please open an [issue](https://github.com/thewpleague/wordpress-powerup/issues) and describe your need.
